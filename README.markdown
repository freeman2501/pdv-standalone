# PDV standalone

This is a standalone version of Tobias Schlitt's famous phpDocumentor for Vim plugin.

I was pretty happy with Tobias' original plugin (thanks Tobias!) but i had two issues
with it:

 * You had to alter the code to configure the plugin
 * Tobias integrated the latest version into his new VIP (VIM integration for PHP)
repository but i didn't need/want the rest in there

If you prefer Tobias' original repo, you find it at `tobyS/vip`.
